  "Pretty Printing" by Derek Oppen, 1980 As far as I know, this is the
  original attempt at defining a generic pretty-printing library. It
  introduces the concept of 'groups' that are broken all at once, or
  not at all. A streaming algorithm is given that processes the input
  with latency limited to the

  printing in Rust, by Darin Morrison and Jon Sterling. Follows the
  Lindig implementation.

  Wadler's "prettier printer" paper. Derives an implementation from
  the specification (though somewhat sketchily in places). This
  algorithm remeasures nested groups when making decisions about
  whether to flatten a group or not.

  Lindig's "Strictly Pretty". An implementation of Wadler's algorithm
  in OCaml that "inlines" some of the laziness, but retains the
  exponential worst case time.

- http://pauillac.inria.fr/~fpottier/pprint/ Fran√ßois Pottier's pretty
  printing library. Like Oppen's system, and Bloom's `fipp` library
  and the Chitil and Kiselyov et al algorithms, this library doesn't
  take into account trailing text on the same line as a group we are
  making a decision about. Wadler's library, and Lindig's, take into
  account trailing context on the same line, giving better layouts and
  avoiding the problem described in one of fipp's issues.

  followed up by Kiselyov et al in their dequeue based system. The
  final system with the co-routines looks very similar to the
  Oppen-style solution I have ended up with.

  Similar to the 'alignment_spaces' stuff.
